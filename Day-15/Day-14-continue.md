- AZURE COMES WITH PRE-CONFIG ENV FOR K8S - DEV/TEST IS FOR TESTING AND DEV
- WE HAVE PROD CLUSTER AS WELL
- WE HAVE ADVANCED FREATURE LIKE AUTO-UPDATE
- WE HAVE TO USE AGENTPOOL BE'COZ AKS IS THE MANAGED KUBERNETES SERVICE BUT TO RUN YOUR WORKLOAD OR SYSTEM WORKLOADS PODS & APPLICATIONS WE NEED A VIRTUAL MACHINE THIS POOL ACTUALLY PROVIDES THE RESOUCES FOR THE COMPUTE
- NODE POOL IS THE POOL OF THE VM's FOR OUR CLUSTER

- BASICALLY WE WE SELECT SCALE METHOD AS AUTO-SCALE WE WILL BE USING VIRUTAL MACHINE SCALE SET FEATURE OR AUTOSCALING FEATURE OF THE AZURE WHERE THE KUBERENTES CLUSTERS CAN BE SCALED AUTOMATICALLY
- THAT MEANS IF YOUR KUBERNETES CLUSTER IS SETUPED TO 1 NODE INTIALLY WHEN THERE IS A MORE TRAFFIC KUBERNETES CLUSTER OR YOUR APPLICATION THEN THE VM SCALE SET AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON THE MIN AND MAC NODE COUNT.

### NOTE : KEEP THE NODE COUNT AS LIMIT THE REASON IS THAT IN SOME CASES WHEN OUR FIREWALL IS BREACHED AND IF SOME HACKER IS ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR CLUSTER YOUR APPLICATIONS THEN THEY CAN PERFORM SOME DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK 
### AND IF WE ARE SCALING IT TO SOME NUMBER LIKE 10 20 100 YOUR APPLICATION WITH WITHSTAND THE HACKER ATTACK THE DENAL OF SERVICE ATTACK (DOS) WHERE HACKER IS SENDING 1 MINILLION REQUEST TO YOUR APPLICATION, APPLICATION 
### MIGHT WITH STAND BE'COZ YOU HAVE ENABLED AUTO SCALING, BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU WILL CHARGED VERY HEAVILY BY THE AZURE.

- WE HAVE ALSO ADD MULTIPLE WORK LOADS 1 FOR KUBERNETES SYSTEM WORKLOADS
- 1 FOR APPLICAITON WORKLOADS.
