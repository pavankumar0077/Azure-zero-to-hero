## AUTHENTICATION
- PEOPLE WITH VALID ID OR VALID ACCOUNT
- USERS AND GROUPS

## AUTHORIZATION
- AUTHORIZATION IS IMP THING WHICH IS VERIFYING IF SOFTWARE ENGINEER IS ALLOWED TO OR AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE DATA CENTER OR NETWORK ENGINEER IS AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE CAFETERIA.
-  LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE IF DEV'S, NEED TO CREATE A VM we will give access to CREATE IT BUT NOT DELETE IT, IF manager need to see how all the resources then we will give READ ACCESS.
-  ROLES ( DEV, QA, MANAGER )
-  IF DEV THEN WE HAVE READ_ONLY ROLE
-  QA - ACCESS VM ROLE
-  these are examples.
